      Back in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to try my hand on
      something highly engaging to survive the lockdown. My first foray into web
      development was building a website for my small business using WordPress.
      This project led me deep down the rabbit hole of coding and web
      development, ending up working at a Tech company as a Frontend web
      developer the following year.
      <br/>
      Having studied both Engineering and Applied Arts, I spent years exploring
      both fields until I settled where Engineering meets Art and Design.
      Minimal on the surface yet maximal in functionality, are the designs I
      most enjoy working on.
   <br/>
      When I'm not at the computer, you can find me in my studio behind my
      sewing machine, designing bags and apparel. Photography has been a lifelong hobby of mine.
