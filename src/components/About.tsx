      My journey into coding began in 2018 while working as an Assistant ITPM.
      Managing web development projects sparked my fascination with how lines of
      code turn ideas into functional tools. This interest led me to enroll in
      web development courses, where I gained a deeper understanding of creating
      engaging web experiences. Upon completing my courses, I started
      freelancing, focusing on building e-commerce websites for small to
      medium-sized businesses. Each project allowed me to apply my new skills,
      from integrating APIs to designing responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
      <br />
      As my expertise grew, I began working as a full-time frontend developer in
      2021. Now, with years of hands-on experience in web development
      technologies, I have a deep understanding of computer science
      fundamentals, strong proficiency in UI/UX design principles, and expertise
      in developing scalable and dynamic web applications. I am adept at
      translating design mockups from Figma into efficient, clean code that not
      only meets but exceeds performance standards.
      <br />A fun fact about me is that, besides my engineering background, I
      also hold a masterâ€™s degree in fashion design. I enjoy bringing my design
      ideas to life not only on the screen but also in tangible forms like
      clothes and accessories. Having studied both engineering and applied arts
      has provided me with a unique blend of technical expertise and design
      sensibility, allowing me to approach frontend development from both a
      practical and aesthetic standpoint. Minimal on the surface yet maximal in
      functionality are the designs I most enjoy working on.
